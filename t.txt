To set up your project with UIKit in Swift and implement the described functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:

Create a new Xcode project:

Open Xcode and select "Create a new Xcode project."
Choose "App" under iOS, then select "Single View App" and click "Next."
Enter a name for your project and select Swift as the language.
Design the user interface:

Open Main.storyboard.
Drag a UITableView onto the initial view controller.
Create a prototype cell for the table view with a style of "Subtitle".
Set the cell reuse identifier.
Add other UI elements (like buttons, labels, image views) to the detail view controller for displaying state information.
Create Cocoa Touch files:

Right-click on your project folder in Xcode.
Choose "New File...".
Select "Cocoa Touch Class" and click "Next".
Enter the class name, for example, StateTableViewCell, and make sure it's a subclass of UITableViewCell.
Repeat the same steps for creating a detail view controller class, let's name it StateDetailViewController.
Connect UI elements to code:

Open ViewController.swift for the initial view controller.
Create outlets for the table view.
Create an array to hold the state data.
Implement UITableViewDataSource methods to populate the table view.
Implement UITableViewDelegate method to handle cell selection and segue to the detail view controller.
Implement data model:

Create a State struct or class to represent the state data (name, nickname, flag image, map image, area, etc.).
Populate an array of State objects with the data for each state.
Prepare for segue:

Implement prepare(for:sender:) method in the initial view controller to pass data to the detail view controller before segueing.
Display state information:

Implement the StateDetailViewController to display the state information passed from the initial view controller.
Load and display images:

Implement methods to load and display flag and map images in the detail view controller.
Run and test:

Build and run your project on a simulator or device to test the functionality.
By following these steps, you should be able to create the app using UIKit in Swift with the described features. Remember to refer to the official documentation and resources for detailed implementation of each step.
